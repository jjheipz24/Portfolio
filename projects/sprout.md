This was my senior capstone project at RIT. I was part of a team of three developers and three designers, who worked for an entire semester designing and building this application from start to finish. I acted as our team's full stack developer--developing the code and logic for adding, removing, and growing the plants, as well as assisting with tasks related to database work and schema creation.

The goal of this project was to help people feel more connected with each other through the exchange of positive and encouraging messages. We wanted to create an experience that would symbolize how spreading kindness to others results in something beautiful.
